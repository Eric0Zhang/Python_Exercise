# Python_Exercise
 Learning Python with MOOC.
# Using Github
 And trying to use github to organize all my recent codes.
 Try to use github with its desktop version, cmd version, and vscode.
 It's very convinient. Cool enough!
# Using Markdown
 It seems github doesn't support toc function, it's a pity.
